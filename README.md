Summary:
Cookie Clicker is an incremental idle game where the player clicks on a cookie to earn cookies. The goal is to accumulate as many cookies as possible by repeatedly clicking the cookie and using the cookies earned to buy various upgrades that automate cookie production.

Basic Instructions:
- When the game starts, you will see a cookie in the center of the screen. The first thing to do is click on the cookie to start earning cookies.
- Every time you click on the cookie, you will earn 1 cookie.
- Each time you purchase an upgrade, its cookie production increases. For example, buying a Level 1 upgrade gives you an auto-clicker that adds 1 cookie every 10 seconds.
